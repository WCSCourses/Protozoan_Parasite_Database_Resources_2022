# Working with Protozoan Parasite Database Resources 2022 (Africa)
Learn how to use online resources for genomic-scale data analysis of protozoan parasites
This course aims to provide Africa-based biomedical researchers and scientists working on protozoan parasites with hands-on experience in genomic-scale data analysis; including genome browsers and comparison tools, primary data analysis, methods for data integration and resources for sophisticated data mining (including the VEuPathDB search strategy system).

Examples and exercises will be drawn primarily from the VEuPathDB.org resources focusing on protozoan parasites including Apicomplexa (i.e. Plasmodium, Toxoplasma & Cryptosporidium) and Kinetoplastida (ie. Trypanosoma & Leishmania). Applicants working on any organism included in these resources will benefit.

The intensive programme will combine hands-on exercises with lectures and discussions on genomics and bioinformatics techniques, along with seminars from distinguished regional guest speakers.

The course is free to attend and open to research scientists and clinicians/clinical scientists/healthcare professionals based in Africa working with protozoan parasitic organisms. Prior coding or bioinformatics knowledge is not required.

This is a virtual course, breakout rooms will be heavily used to ensure adequate teacher/student ratio and to foster active discussion. Lectures will be recorded and made available to students.


# Learning Outcomes

After attending this course, participants should be able to:

Use state-of-the-art bioinformatics software including web-based resources as well as in a UNIX-like environment to explore parasite datasets

Identify opportunities and limitations of the different methodologies in analysing parasite genomics data

Apply software and web-based resources to visualise and analyse next generation sequencing datasets for parasitology research

Apply software and web-based services to browse genomes and to display genome comparisons

Integrate and query large-scale genomic and functional genomic databases to answer biology-related research questions and develop testable hypotheses
